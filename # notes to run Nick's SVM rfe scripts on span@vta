# notes to run Nick's SVM rfe scripts on span@vta linux box:  

# log onto via:
ssh -XY span@vta.stanford.edu


# cd to scripts dir:
cd /home/span/lvta/cuesvm/svmrfe_032918


# activate virtual environment: 
source venv/bin/activate


# run wrapper script, which calls sgdrfe.py: 
python run_sgdrfe_relapse.py si151120


# where si151120 is the test subject

# this outputs a csv file and some nifti files. The csv files contains the following info: 

# test_subject, clftype, n_features, %features, accuracy, f1, precision, recall, roc_auc, r2

#e.g.: si151120,elasticnet,30817,0.040,0.527,0.585,0.521,0.666,0.527,-0.888

# repeat this for all subjects

**********
# once this is done, copy plot_svm_accuracy.R script into the output folder that contains csv files, and run it from the command line with: 

Rscript plot_svm_accuracy.R

# note: as of now this errors, but still makes the file, Rplots.pdf...

xv rfe_accuracy.png

# C values: "slack" parameter in the SVM; if its easy to distinguish classes, a high (or low?) slack is better...

***********

next, see what running the script, check_coefs.py does...
